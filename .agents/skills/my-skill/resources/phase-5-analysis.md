# Phase 5: Comprehensive Benchmarking & Analysis

**Duration:** Week 9

This phase involves collecting all performance data generated by your C++ implementations and conducting mathematical analysis.

## Objectives
*   **Step 1: Strong Scaling.** Keep the image size fixed at 4096×4096 and increase the number of processors/threads (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32...). Plot execution time versus core count.
*   **Step 2: Weak Scaling (Optional).** Increase the image size proportionally with the number of processors to evaluate how the system handles larger workloads.
*   **Step 3: Compute Metrics.** Calculate **Speedup** ($S = \frac{T_{serial}}{T_{parallel}}$) and **Parallel Efficiency** ($E = \frac{S}{P}$, where P is processors) for every implementation.
*   **Step 4: Data Visualization.** Export your C++ timing logs to CSV and generate line charts and bar graphs comparing all methods (Serial, Pthreads, OpenMP, MPI, Hybrid, GPU).
