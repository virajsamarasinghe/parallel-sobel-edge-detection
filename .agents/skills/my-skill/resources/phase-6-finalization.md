# Phase 6: Finalization & Documentation

**Duration:** Week 10

The final phase focuses on packaging the C++ project for submission and open-source release.

## Objectives
*   **Step 1: Code Cleanup.** Refactor the C++ codebase for readability. Ensure memory safety (no memory leaks with `malloc`/`free` or `new`/`delete`), add comprehensive comments, and enforce consistent naming conventions.
*   **Step 2: Build System & Documentation.** Create a `CMakeLists.txt` or a `Makefile` that handles compiling the serial, OpenMP, Pthreads, MPI, and CUDA targets automatically. Update the repository `README.md` with build instructions.
*   **Step 3: Final Report.** Compile findings into the final academic report, focusing heavily on the performance analysis, the challenges faced during the MPI halo exchange, and C++/GPU memory management.
